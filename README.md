# ⭐Plant-Disease-Detection
* Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using Convoluitona neural Netowork for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. For Training we are using Plant village dataset. Dataset Link is in My Blog Section.

## ⭐Run Project in your Machine
* You must have python install in your machine.
* Create a Python Virutal Environment & Activate Virutal Environment [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewJWAiduGuld_9oGSrTuLumg9y62qS6A?usp=share_link)
* Add the downloaded file in `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.


## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each Image have it's disease name so you can verify model is working perfact or not.
